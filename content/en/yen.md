Welcome to my Digital Garden. Here you can find all the ideas and notes about what i've learned in my journey as a university student and as a self-taught learner.

## How to navigate
Notes are maintained following some Zettelkasten principles, this allows you navigate between them using hyperlinks.

##### Menu
On the navbar you can find relevant sections of my garden, such as:
- Maps of Content. Serve as Entry points to the topics of this website.
- Question Banks. Here i storage all the questions and answers of the topics i've learned, they can help to build practice tests and flashcards

##### Theme
You can change between light and dark theme using the sun or moon icon next to the search bar on top of any page.

##### Search
You can search any note or idea on the whole website. Try using keywords, prefixes or suffixes.

##### Language
The site is available in english and spanish. Since i maintain both versions and do the traductions by hand i apologize if some content is not available in one language or the other, i promise it will!
